Google AI Studio – Gemini Agent Integration

This repository demonstrates the integration of Google AI Studio and the Gemini API for building intelligent, conversational agents. The project focuses on leveraging Gemini’s large language capabilities to generate structured, context-aware responses and automate cognitive tasks programmatically.

Overview

The objective of this project is to explore Google’s **Gemini model** using the official SDKs and APIs to:
- Implement AI-driven text generation and reasoning.
- Build foundational agent workflows for automation.
- Integrate Gemini capabilities into custom Python applications.

## Features

- **Gemini API Integration:** Seamless connection with Google’s generative AI platform.  
- **Prompt Engineering Support:** Structured input formatting for consistent model behavior.  
- **Environment Configuration:** Secure API key handling through `.env`.  
- **Customizable Workflows:** Easily extendable for chatbots, content generation, and data analysis.
